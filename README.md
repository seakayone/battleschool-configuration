# Introduction

This is my personal starter configuration for use with [battleschool](https://github.com/spencergibb/battleschool) on Mac OS X Yosemite.

In order to you it you must checkout the .battleschool folder into you home and have battleschool installed. Follow these steps:

# Install battleschool

    #if needed
    sudo easy_install pip

    sudo pip install battleschool

# Install dev environment

    battle -K
