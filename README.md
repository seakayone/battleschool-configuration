# Introduction

This is my personal starter configuration for use with [battleschool](https://github.com/spencergibb/battleschool) on Mac OS X Yosemite.

In order to use it you must have battleschool installed and checkout the contents of this folder into ~/.battleschool. Follow these steps to install battleschool and get your environment up:

# Install Battleschool

    #if needed
    sudo easy_install pip

    sudo pip install battleschool

# Install Dev Environment

    battle -K
